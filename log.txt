            Date to work. Will need to focus on materials related to Date syntax in Javascript.

            website tests. The code still passes all tests in the html file.

Task:       During this period I setup the basic html, javascript and css files for assignment 3 part 2. A very basic html structure and css 
            style was implmented to show a search button, results, and favorites. I implemented some javascript functions to change the html 
            text inside those areas for onload and when pressing the button. Also, I got the server request for gists working and stored into 
            an object using JSON parse.

Task:       Successfully separated writeLines function. Was having trouble because I started calling the AJAX function from the writeLines. Needed 
            AJAX calling the writeLines due to asynchronus behavior of AJAX. I got filtering function working.

Tasks:      I added git ignore to ignore VS build files. During this time I struggled with trying to understand how to get more than 1 page request
            from gists API. It was through the message boards that I finally realized the page= was the page number it was returning, not the 
            number of pages. Some minor changes to functions were made to simplify or remove unnecessary variables

Tasks:      During this time I got the multiple ajax requests working so that I could get 150 results to work with. I essentially made 2 different 
            functions for the requests which is not ideal. If time I will try to change code so that I don't need the duplicate function.

Tasks:      During this time I worked out how to validate the number of pages implemented. I made a decision to rule out leaving the input field blank.

Tasks:      I added (1-5) to display of placeholder

Date End:       Sun Apr 26 11:54:22 2015 +1000
Tasks:      Played around with some css styling. For this commit I only made the search box big enough to see placeholder on all browsers. Chrome was 
            the limiting factor requiring the size be 275px minimum. I changed the border from all around the gists to just the bottom. Will
            branch to move button position to front of div

Date End:       Sun Apr 26 12:46:29 2015 +1000
Tasks:      Moved button in front of div. Played around with some more styling putting buttons and descriptions in their own divs, but I could not
            acheive the layout I was looking for. I will need to play around with html and css some more in future.

Date End:       Sun Apr 26 13:07:25 2015 +1000
Tasks:      Error msg to console due to both AJAX requests being called at the same time. I implemented a solution that would wait to call the 2nd AJAX
            request and filtering(by favorites) and output from the 2nd AJAX call. Unfortunately this has made the output a little slow.

Date:           Sun Apr 26 15:07:46 2015 +1000
Tasks:      Implemented filter with checkboxes. Since I had the filter function working already, I just needed to get the checkboxes and pass the
                correct input to the filter

Date:           Sun Apr 26 15:37:25 2015 +1000
Tasks:      My Global gist array was retaining all the gists data for each search. I implemented a solution to clear the array for each search. I also
            played with the feature on the button_changes branch. Again I could not get it to work.

Tasks:      During this time I edited scripts.js file to conform to JS Lint standards. Further testing to verify edits did not break the website. I could
            not completey conform to JS Lint standards the writeFavorites and writeResults functions needing to insert a function in the button. Which needs
            to later call the appropriate functions. HTML and Style sheets validated to HTML5 and CSS2.1
