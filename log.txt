Task:  During this period I setup the basic html, javascript and css files for assignment 3 part 2. A very basic html structure and css 
        style was implmented to show a search button, results, and favorites. I implemented some javascript functions to change the html 
        text inside those areas for onload and when pressing the button. Also, I got the server request for gists working and stored into 
        an object using JSON parse.

Task: Successfully separated writeLines function. Was having trouble because I started calling the AJAX function from the writeLines. Needed 
        AJAX calling the writeLines due to asynchronus behavior of AJAX. I got filtering function working.

Tasks:  I added git ignore to ignore VS build files. During this time I struggled with trying to understand how to get more than 1 page request
            from gists API. It was through the message boards that I finally realized the page= was the page number it was returning, not the 
            number of pages. Some minor changes to functions were made to simplify or remove unnecessary variables

Tasks:     During this time I got the multiple ajax requests working so that I could get 150 results to work with. I essentially made 2 different 
            functions for the requests which is not ideal. If time I will try to change code so that I don't need the duplicate function.

Tasks:  During this time I worked out how to validate the number of pages implemented. I made a decision to rule out leaving the input field blank.

Tasks:  Played around with some css styling. For this commit I only made the search box big enough to see placeholder on all browsers. Chrome was 
            the limiting factor requiring the size be 275px minimum. I changed the border from all around the gists to just the bottom. Will
            branch to move button position to front of div
