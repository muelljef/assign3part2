Task:  During this period I setup the basic html, javascript and css files. A very basic html structure and css style was implmented to show a search button,
            results, and favorites. I implemented some javascript functions to change the html text inside those areas for onload and when pressing the button.
            Also, I got the server request for gists working and stored into an object using JSON parse.
